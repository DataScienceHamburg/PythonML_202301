# %% Hubble Exercise
# In this tutorial you will take a look at measurements of Hubble (the telescope). Besides taking beautiful pictures, it measured speed and distance of Super-Novae. Similar data was used in 1929 by Hubble (the person) and he found out that there is a linear relationship.


# He discovered that galaxies appear to move away. This can be visualised with red-shift of spectral lines. This observation was the first indication that the universe expands.

# You will create a linear model based on observations and create predictions.

# Steps:
# 0. Import required packages
# 1. Import the data
# 2. visualise the data for better understanding
# 3. Create a linear regression model
# 4. create predictions
# 5. calculate the $R^2$ metric
# 6. Bonus: calculate the Hubble Constant: $H_0=\frac{v}{D}$
